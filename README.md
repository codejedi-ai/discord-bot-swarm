# discord-bot-example

## Description
This project is a Discord bot built using Node.js and the `discord.js` library. The bot can be configured using environment variables stored in a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NodejsConsoleApp3.git
   cd NodejsConsoleApp3
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Discord bot token:
   ```

env


   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   ```

## Running the Bot

1. **Authorize the bot**:
   Before running the bot, you need to authorize it to join your Discord server. Use the following URL to authorize your bot:
   ```
   https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=1096620642230607943&scope=bot&permissions=8
   ```

2. **Run the bot**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the bot and you should see output in the console indicating that the bot is running.

## Additional Information

- **Commands**:
  The bot currently supports the following commands:
  - `ping`: Replies with "Pong!"

- **Environment Variables**:
  The bot uses environment variables for configuration. Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly set up with the required variables.

## Troubleshooting

- **401: Unauthorized Error**:
  If you encounter a `401: Unauthorized` error, ensure that your bot token is correct and has not been revoked. You can regenerate the token from the Discord Developer Portal if needed.

- **Module Type Warning**:
  If you see a warning about the module type, ensure that your `package.json` file includes `"type": "module"`.
